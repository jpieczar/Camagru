# Camagru
A website that allows you to upload photos and overlay stickers onto them. Part of my 42 (WeThinkCode_) school project.

This is a instagram type project that required the use of PHP, MySQL, and Javascript (JS). It allows a registered user to either upload a picture or take one using the devices's webcam and then add a sticker or a frame to it and save it to their gallery. A registered user is able to like and comment on a post while an unregistered visiter to the site can only view posts on the public feed.

I mainly use procedural programming (in PHP) for this. The only PDO is for connecting to a databse.

1. Download and install Lamp/Mamp to your computer from Bitnami.
2. Within Lamp/Mamp, navigate to apache2/htdocs and clone this repo into there.
3. Launch the application then navigate to /Camagru/setup.php.
4. You are now able to use the site once the database has been setup.
